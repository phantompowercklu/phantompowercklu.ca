### *a music show*

## Who are we?
Phantom Power is a community radio show hosted (almost) every Saturday at 10:00 PM EST.
We pride ourselves in providing some of the unplucked gems of the world of classic and modern rock.

Phantom Power is hosted by Jeremy and [Evan](https://evannosich.ca) Nosich, cousins and lifelong music enthusiasts.
