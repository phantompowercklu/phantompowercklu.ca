## Who are we?
Phantom Power is a community radio show hosted (almost) every Saturday at 10:00 PM EST.
We pride ourselves in providing some of the unplucked gems of the world of classic and modern rock.

Phantom Power is hosted by [Jeremy and Evan Nosich](hosts.markdown), cousins and lifelong music enthusiasts.

Archives of our old shows can be found [here](archives.markdown).
