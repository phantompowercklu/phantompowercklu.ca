## Evan Nosich
A 22-year-old computer science student, Evan currently handles internal IT for CKLU, along with web development for both [CKLU](https://cklu.ca)
and Phantom Power. He's been interested in music since a very young age, picking up the guitar in his early teens, and branched out to producing
vaporwave a few years later. This would lead him to want to join CKLU, and ask his cousin and a few friends to join in hosting. After a bit of a false start,
with friends moving away, Evan revisited the idea in May of 2019 on a camping trip to Manitoulin Island. After brainstorming for a better name for the show
(originally named "Nickel City Radio") on a rainy drive home, salvation would come in the form of Spotify's shuffle feature. The Tragically Hip's 1998 
song *Something On* gave them the old theme song and name of the show. "Black out to Phantom Power" was the line that started it all. After a two-year
hiatus from hosting due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Evan and Jeremy started hosting live shows again in March of 2022.
