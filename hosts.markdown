## Evan Nosich
A 22-year-old computer science student, Evan currently handles internal IT for CKLU, along with web development for both [CKLU](https://cklu.ca)
and Phantom Power. He's been interested in music since a very young age, picking up the guitar in his early teens, and branched out to producing
vaporwave a few years later. This would lead him to want to join CKLU, and ask his cousin and a few friends to join in hosting. After a bit of a false start,
with friends moving away, Evan revisited the idea in May of 2019 on a camping trip to Manitoulin Island. After brainstorming for a better name for the show
(originally named "Nickel City Radio") on a rainy drive home, salvation would come in the form of Spotify's shuffle feature. The Tragically Hip's 1998 
song *Something On* gave them the old theme song and name of the show. "Black out to Phantom Power" was the line that started it all. After a two-year
hiatus from hosting due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Evan and Jeremy started hosting live shows again in March of 2022.

## Jeremy Nosich
{: style="text-align:right"}
A 21-year-old forensic science student, Jeremy is the cohost for Phantom Power. He's been listening to music for most of his life, starting out with the
hit songs of the early 2000's that constantly played on the car radio to his favorite 60's and 70's songs that helps him get through his heavy university workloads.
This sudden change in music choice came around middle school, but peaked in high school when he started to learn how to play bass guitar along with his friends
in their band "The Nickel City Hitchhikers" whose first performed songs included Creedence Clearwater Revival's 'Fortunate Son' and the Eagle's 'Take it Easy'.
His taste in music, greatly influenced by his early days in a band, centered around the pop culture of the 60's and early 70's, with CCR being his favorite band.
He spent his time further gathering more songs to share on air during the hiatus, whether on his own time or recommended by a friend, he never forgets where he hears a track he likes,
further emphasizing CKLU's motto "Your Station". Jeremy knows how music can change the tune of any event, as many memorable moments in his life have been defined by it, thus giving rise to
Phantom Power's motto "the soundtrack for your Saturday night shenanigans".
